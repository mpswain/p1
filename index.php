  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <p>Hi, I'm Michael Swain, from Buffalo. (Yes, it's snowing.)</p>

  <p>I've been involved with the web since the mid-'90s (think blinking text, flaming skulls, etc.), and I took a bunch of courses in the Extension School and was enrolled in the masters in IT (software engineering) before kids and career happened.</p>

  <p>I'm looking forward to a deep dive in modern web technologies and workflows. I do some work in Drupal which runs on PHP, so this course should help in that regard as well.</p>
